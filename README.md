Project Description

I will be making a personal portfolio.

Day 1: [12-10]

Daily Reflections

Today's Progess

On day 1, I created the files in order to start my portfolio. I mainly focused on my home page in which I created a logo and navbar inside of my header. Then I used the h1 element to put my name and I added an image for my profile picture.

Goal for the next day

Tomorrow I will focus on my about me page. I will write a short description about me and place my profile image onside of it. Under it I added some tab links using Javascript.

Day 2: [12-11]

Todays Progess

On day 2 I focused on creating my about me page.

Day 3: [12-12]

Today's Progress

On day 3 I finished my about me page. Then I started working on my service page. I will finish it on day 4.

Challenges and Blockers

My bootsrap was overriding my custom css. I fixed it by taking the stylesheet rel out of the bootstrap link.

Goal for the next day

Finish my service page!

Day 4: {12-13}

On day 4, I ended up finishing my project.

Challenges and Blockers

None.

Final Reflections

I created a personal portfolio.Everything function well and came out as expected.

I improved in using JavaScript.

I left the experienced tab link empty for the future!
I also left the project page empty for the future!

Attribution

I used ChatGPT for some JavaScript.

I watched a youtube video for a tutorial on my about me page.
